Brief Description of Goal of Code:
	The goal of this code is to learn how to display things like shapes, lines, text and images on a HTML drawing canvas
        that also fits on a phone screen. We need to add buttons that draw the following things when pressed:
        	a rectangle onto the canvas (shape)
		my name onto the canvas
		load an image onto canvas
		reset (clear) the canvas
		
        
 
Known Issues:
blah, blah, blah, blah
